# CASE STUDY

## Objective

Leverage Fitbit fitness tracker data to provide valuable marketing and business insights to WeFit and its associated companies.

## Company Overview

WeFit originated from the vision of two Indian fitness enthusiasts, Rohit and Anjali Shah, who aimed to build a community that embraced fitness at all levels. Starting as a modest gym in a lively urban area, they offered diverse classes and training programs to be inclusive and accessible to everyone.

As WeFit expanded, the founders diversified their offerings beyond in-person classes. They began selling fitness equipment like weights, machines, and apparel both in physical stores and online. Additionally, they launched their own fitness apps to help users monitor workouts, set goals, and connect with the WeFit community.

WeFit also ventured into personalized diet plans curated by a team of nutritionists and dietitians, which integrated seamlessly into the users' fitness routines. These plans, along with a new line of meal replacement products, aimed to meet individual health and fitness goals.

With a growing online presence, WeFit started offering virtual classes and training programs accessible through their apps or website. These services gained popularity, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person classes were restricted.

Over the years, WeFit became synonymous with high-quality fitness gear, apps, and tailored diet plans, earning a loyal customer base. Their success attracted venture capital funding, helping the company scale its operations and achieve a valuation exceeding $1 billion. Rohit and Anjali's commitment to creating an inclusive fitness community remained strong, driving continuous innovation and expansion.

## Business Task

Utilize Fitbit fitness tracker data to identify smart device usage trends and customer behavior to inform marketing strategies and provide business solutions for WeFit's Analytics team to attract new clients.

## Data Source

The data source used for this case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle where it was uploaded by Möbius. The dataset was made available by Möbius to Kaggle.com under the terms of the CC0: Public Domain Creative Common License, which waives all ownership rights in the work and permits unrestricted use of the dataset for performance, distribution, and copying. Furberg, Robert, Brinton, Julia, Keating, and Ortiz, Alexa were the authors who Möbius cited in relation to the Zendo dataset. (See the Source) These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

## Business Scenarios

### Scenario 1: LeanFit's Personalized Diet Plans

LeanFit, a WeFit subsidiary, sells personalized diet plans but has experienced declining sales recently. The Analytics team needs to identify potential customers likely to purchase these weight loss plans using Fitbit data.

Weight loss plans often require consultation with healthcare professionals to ensure suitability. Individuals across various demographics may seek weight loss plans for health improvement, fitness goals, or specific medical conditions. Analyzing BMI, heart rate, and other health indicators can help identify potential customers for LeanFit.

### Scenario 2: FitWear's Online Sales Expansion

FitWear, another WeFit subsidiary, offers fitness apparel and gear. With plans to transition to online sales, the company needs to identify customers likely to purchase their products online using Fitbit data.

Potential customers include individuals who are active for more than 20 days a month, recording significant active minutes. By analyzing usage patterns, the Analytics team can pinpoint customers interested in upgrading or starting their fitness journey with FitWear products.

### Scenario 3: Sleepy-Nights' Sleep Scheduling App

Sleepy-Nights, a WeFit subsidiary, developed a sleep scheduling app to optimize users' sleep cycles. To increase app subscriptions, the company aims to target customers struggling with maintaining sleep schedules.

Sleep deprivation, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, concentration issues, and mood changes, affects various individuals. Analyzing sleep patterns from Fitbit data can help identify customers who would benefit from Sleepy-Nights' app.

### Scenario 4: Dashboard Creation for Management

WeFit's Analytics team needs to create a comprehensive dashboard using Fitbit data to present to management. This includes:

1. Identifying unique user IDs.
2. Calculating the number of days users wore their fitness trackers.
3. Categorizing users into Active (>20 days), Moderate (>10,<20 days), and Light (<10 days) users.
4. Determining the mean distance traveled by each user.
5. Grouping users into Pro, Intermediate, and Beginner categories based on the mean distance.
6. Calculating total steps and calories burned by each user.
7. Analyzing fairly active, lightly active, and very active minutes.
8. Repeating these calculations for distinct dates to visualize trends over time.

## Conclusion

By analyzing Fitbit fitness tracker data, WeFit can derive actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies and provide tailored business solutions for its subsidiaries, ensuring continued growth and customer satisfaction.
